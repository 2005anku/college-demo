variable name should not begin within a number.As an example
int25var; //25var is an invalid variable

whitespace is not perimitted in variable names.As an example,
int average score;//invalid variables.
There is a gap bw average and score.

A java keyword (reserved word)cannot be used as a variable name.
for example int float;//invalid expression as float is defined as a keyword in java.

Here we should use variables names with more than one word with all lowercase letters letter for the first word and
capitalization of the first letter of each subsequent word.Take ,for example,averagescore.This is called camelcase.

When creating variables,it's preferable to give them meaningful names-age,earning,value for example,make more sense than
variable names like a,e,and v.

Use all lowercase letters when creating one-word variables names.it's preaferable to use John rather than JOHN or jOHN,for
example.
